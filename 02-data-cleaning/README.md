This folder contains the following notebooks, to be executed in order within the model pipeline:

- **01.01-cleaning**: Dealing with missing values, outliers, and parsing
- **01.02-feature-engineering**: Creating new features to improve predictions
- **01.03-scaling**: Encoding, scaling, and normalising
- **01.04-feature-selection**: Removing redundant or uninformative features
- **01.05-dim-reduction**: Dimensionality reduction
